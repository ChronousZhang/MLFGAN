1. Use OpenPose to entract pose image from Market or Market+Duke+CUHK03
2. Use pose image and pedestrian image to train PNGAN
3. Use PNGAN to generate Pose-Normalized training image of Market
4. Random choose 30% generate image and all raw training image as the final training image, then training MLFGAN model
5. How to Training:
   - cd script/experiment
   - python train.py
6. Our training is three stages. 
    - First, train base branch;   (for basic recongization)
    - Then, fix base branch and train alignment branch;  (for saving training time) 
    - Finally, open these two branch for training. (base branch can not guide alignment any more, open they for further training)
7. Test at raw test image of market, you can pose-normalized test image in real world, but not in here for fair compariation
